Museum Ticket Booking Chatbot
This project is a Flask-based chatbot for an online museum ticket booking system. The chatbot interacts with users to assist with ticket bookings, cancellations, and general inquiries. It's designed as a simple conversational interface that can be expanded with more features.

Features
Basic conversation handling: The chatbot responds to greetings, booking requests, cancellations, and polite expressions.
Ticket booking assistance: Offers to assist users in booking tickets (note: actual booking functionality needs further implementation).
Flask API: Provides a simple /chat route to handle user input via HTTP POST requests.
Easy customization: The chatbotâ€™s responses are based on basic text matching and can be easily modified to suit your needs.
How It Works
The chatbot processes user input by matching keywords (e.g., "hello", "book", "cancel", "thanks") and provides appropriate responses. It helps users start a conversation about booking tickets, asking for details like the number of tickets or booking ID for cancellations.

Example Interactions:
User: "Hello"

Bot: "Hello! Welcome to the museum ticket booking system. How can I assist you today?"
User: "I want to book tickets"

Bot: "Sure! I can help you with booking tickets. How many tickets would you like to book?"
User: "I want to cancel my booking"

Bot: "To cancel a booking, please provide your booking ID."

Future Improvements
Add a database: Store and retrieve actual bookings.
Enhance natural language understanding (NLP): Use NLP libraries such as spaCy or NLTK for more sophisticated conversation handling.
Multi-language support: Expand the chatbot to support multiple languages.
Machine learning: Integrate a machine learning model to improve responses over time based on user interactions.
